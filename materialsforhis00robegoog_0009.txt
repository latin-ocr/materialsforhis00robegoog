'Phe works to be published in octavo, separately, as
they were finishcd3 the whole responsibility of the task
resting upon the edtors, who were to bc chosen by the
Mastor oi tho Itolls with the sanction of the Treasurv.

The Iords of Her Majesty’s Trcasmy, after a carehd
consideration of the subject, expressed their opinion in a
Treasury Minuta, dated February 9, 1857, that the plan
recommended by the Master of the Rolls “was well
calculated for tho aecem-plishment of this important
national object, in an effectual and satisfactory manner,
within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention be

ι paid to economy, in making the detailed arrangements,

without imnecessary expense.”

'l‘hoy expressed their approbation of the proposal that
sach Ohronicle and historica] document should be edited
in such amanncr as to represent with all possible correct·
ness the text of each writer, derived from a collation of the
best Mss, and that no notes should bc added, except!
such as were illustrative of the various readings. They
suggested, however, that the preface to each work should
oontain, in addition to tho particulare proposed by the
Master of the Rolls, abiogruphical account of thc author,
so far as authentia materials existed for that purpose,

and an estimato of his historical eredibility and value.
